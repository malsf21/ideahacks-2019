# IDEA Hacks 2019

This is the repository for the project I (Matthew Wang) made with four other teammates (Allison Chen, Ashvin Nagarajan, Jeff Anderson, and Juan Banchs) made at [IDEA Hacks 2019](http://www.ideahacks.la).

We made a smart lock, powered by an Arduino 101 and a Sunfounder RFID-RC522 reader. More details coming soon :)

We're still in progress on this project, so get back to us in a bit!
