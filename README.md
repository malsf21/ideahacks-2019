# IDEA Hacks 2019

This is the repository for the project I (Matthew Wang) made with four other teammates (Allison Chen, Ashvin Nagarajan, Jeff Anderson, and Juan Banchs) at [IDEA Hacks 2019](http://www.ideahacks.la).

We made a smart lock, powered by an Arduino 101 and a Sunfounder RFID-RC522 reader. We set up our reader using the [Sunfounder Wiki's experiment tutorial](http://wiki.sunfounder.cc/index.php?title=Mifare_RC522_Module_RFID_Reader).

We're still in progress on this project, so get back to us in a bit!

## Project Breakdown

The `main` folder contains `main.ino`, the main program that controls our lock and responds to RFID signals, and the file that is supposed to ship with the product. It has a few functions:
* Controls the servo that locks and unlocks the lock.
* Reads the correct RFID IDs that are allowed to lock and unlock the EEPROM - more information in the EEPROM section.
* Controls the LEDs that show the lock status - unlocked is green, locked is red.
* Manages the creation of new valid RFIDs - if an RFID object is read in while the lock is unlocked, it writes it to the EEPROM and locks the lock.
* Creates a `BLEPeripheral` object to interface with a Bluetooth Low Energy device, with two characteristics:
	* `lockCharacteristic`, which returns either `0` or `1` for the lock being unlocked or locked, respectively
	* `passwordCharacteristic`, which receives a numeric password from the user; if it's correct, it toggles the lock. The numeric password is hard-coded into the program: it's currently `1337`

The `utilities` folder contains two files, `getId.ino` and `memory_management.ino`, which are designed to help developers use the application.
* `getId.ino` outputs the ID of any RFID device placed on the RFID reader, which is useful for determing the IDs of any RFID objects. We slightly modified the provided `getId.ino` from [Sunfounder](http://wiki.sunfounder.cc/index.php?title=Mifare_RC522_Module_RFID_Reader).
* `memory_management.ino` contains a set of utility functions that allow the user to easily manipulate the EEPROM onboard the device.

The `lib` folder contains several library files for the RFID board; **they must be copied into `Arduino/libraries` directory for our code to work properly**. We modified the provided libraries provided from [Sunfounder](http://wiki.sunfounder.cc/index.php?title=Mifare_RC522_Module_RFID_Reader), as they caused compilation errors with our Arduino board.

## Arduino Setup

We used an Arduino 101 (with Bluetooth capability) and a Sunfounder RFID-RC522 reader.

|  Input Pin  | Arduino 101 |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Mtr GND     | GND |
| Mtr Power   | 5V |
| Mtr Digital | Digital 8 |
| RFID VCC    | 3.3V |
| RFID RST    | Digital 2 |
| RFID GND    | GND |
| RFID MISO   | Digital 3 |
| RFID MOSI   | Digital 4 |
| RFID SCK    | Digital 5 |
| RFID NSS    | Digital 6 |
| RFID IRQ    | Digital 7 |
| LED Green   | Digital 9 |
| LED Red     | Digital 10|


## EEPROM Allocation

The first four bytes of the EEPROM (0-3) are reserved for parameters for the program. If they are uninitialized (i.e.) their value is `255`), then `main.ino` sets their values in `setupEEPROM()`.

| Byte # | Data Type | Description of Byte |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------- |
| 0      | `unsigned short int` | Holds the state of the lock: `0` is unlocked, `1` is locked. |
| 1      | `unsigned short int` | Holds the number of valid combinations held in memory. |
| 2      | n/a         | Reserved byte for future use. |
| 3      | n/a         | Reserved byte for future use. |

The rest of the available bytes in the EEPROM are used for RFID ID blocks of four bytes, with each block consisting of four one-byte unsigned characters that represent the value of the RFID ID. Assume `0 <= n <= 255`.

| Byte # | Data Type | Description of Byte |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------- |
| 4n     | `unsigned char` | The 1st unsigned char-encoded value of the RFID  |
| 4n+1   | `unsigned char` | The 2nd unsigned char-encoded value of the RFID  |
| 4n+2   | `unsigned char` | The 3rd unsigned char-encoded value of the RFID  |
| 4n+3   | `unsigned char` | The 4th unsigned char-encoded value of the RFID  |

For example, to make the RFID `A34815D3` valid as the first correct RFID, you'd do this:

| Byte # | Data Type | Byte Value |
| ------ | --------- | ---------- |
| 4     | `unsigned char` | 0xA3 |
| 5     | `unsigned char` | 0x48 |
| 6     | `unsigned char` | 0x15 |
| 7     | `unsigned char` | 0xD3 |

Which would look like this in code:

```cpp
// memory_management.ino
insertRfidString(4, 0xA3, 0x48, 0x15, 0xD3);
```

More details coming soon :)
